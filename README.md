# Epileptic Seizure Classification Readme

## Overview

This project focuses on the classification of epileptic seizures in children using a combination of OpenCV, Machine Learning (ML), Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries in Python. The primary objectives were to build a YOLO (Recurrent Neural Network) model for diagnosing seizure events, analyze datasets containing over 10,000 patient EEG readings, and enhance patient care by reducing misclassifications through ML approaches.

## Project Highlights

- Developed a YOLO (RNN) Model for Seizure Detection:
  - Achieved a high accuracy rate of 85% in diagnosing seizure events in children.
  
- Data Analysis with Python Libraries:
  - Utilized Matplotlib and OpenCV for analyzing datasets comprising over 10,000 patient EEG readings.
  
- Improved Patient Care:
  - Employed ML and Python approaches to enhance medical assistance.
  - Resulted in a 30% decrease in misclassifications, leading to more accurate diagnosis and treatment.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- OpenCV: Utilized for image processing and computer vision tasks.
- Machine Learning (ML): Employed ML algorithms for classification tasks.
- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: Utilized for data visualization and plotting.
