Classification of epileptic seizures:  OpenCV, ML, Pandas, and Matplotlib 
•	Built a YOLO(RNN) Model to diagnose seizure events in children with a high accuracy rate of 85%. 
•	Analysed datasets comprising over 10,000 patient EEG readings, utilizing Python Matplotlib and OpenCV. 
•	Enhanced patient care in the management of epilepsy by using ML and Python approaches to improve medical assistance, resulting in a 30% decrease in misclassifications.
